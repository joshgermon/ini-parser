# INI Parser

A totally useless non-spec-compliant INI parser written in C. Made for myself to try and apply C concepts for fun, not for use. Expect messy code, undefined behavior, and general poor practices. :)

- Uses a linear allocator for parsing and storing data.
- Simple hash table implementation to store the key value data.
